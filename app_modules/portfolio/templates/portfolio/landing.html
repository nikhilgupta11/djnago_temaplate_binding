            <p>
                Hello! This is Radhika & Hemant along with our kids - Kiyansh and Kiana ! Wait..Let us introduce you all
                our one more child - Happy Niveshak ! Now its a complete family ! 
                <br /> <br />
                We always wanted to achieve financial freedom which is about doing what we want to, not what we have to.
                We spent our corporate life at Bangalore and then Mumbai but decided to come back to our roots and live
                happily in our hometown i.e Jaipur with our parents and we both are on our way to achieve financial
                freedom. We are very passionate about making the Happy Niveshak community financially free and help
                people put their financial lives in order. <br /> <br />

                We are a strong believer that Good money habits- saving and investing along with Patience and Discipline
                are key to have a peaceful and stress-free life. Managing money is not about doing amazing things as
                much as it is about avoiding financial ruin over long period of time. <br /> <br />

                Our relationship with money is broken and In the current education system, we are not taught much about
                money, how it works, and how to take control of it.
                <br />
                Money gives you freedom and control over your time. It gives you ability to say ‘No’
                This is what we believe and are also a living proof of. Whatever I am saying here is coming from a deep
                belief and experience of 12+ years as a consumer of this philosophy not as an advisor.
                <br /><br />
                Let me tell you some of my personal favorite topics which i am passionate about (apart from Wealth) is
                Health. Wealth often comes at a price. Ensure you do not pay for it with your health, peace of mind and
                time with family and friends.
                <br /><br />
                I follow ayurveda closely and one thing which i like about it is that its a science which focus more on
                understanding you and your body type (Prakruti) before starting diagnosis, similarly we feel that
                Personal finance is more personal than finance.
                <br /><br />
                Before making any financial recommendation - we review clients' financial situation, investment
                objectives, risk tolerance, time horizon, diversification needs, and need for liquidity.
                <br /><br />
                As a family, we believe in Karma and in a process to accumulate more and more good karma by providing
                right, ethical and unbiased advice.
                <br /><br />
